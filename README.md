## Instructions on running locally

1. Ensure Python is installed
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask app using `python app.py`. This will run the app on debug mode on the server's IP
4. **NOTE**: Ensure the Flask app and the client are in the same WLAN to be able to connect to the server's IP as it is otherwise considered a private IP address
